# Camera Battle Transitions 



## Camera transitions

Camera transitions are not something new in the video games industry. Long before ago was a technique used in the cinema world to cut scenes and connect on with another. However the result can be pretty much the same, both industries use very different processes to achieve it. In the cinema world, once the movie is filmed, the department who takes care of the project is pre-production. They will attempt to fix all the incorrections and build smooth scene transitions.

But in video games we cannot do that. Although most of them have an important part we call cinematic, precisely because it inherits all cinema techniques, the rest of the game is not like a movie we can review and edit. Each time a player plays a video game, even the same title, the result would be different. So that in the video games industry the post-production process is practically nonexistent, or rather different from cinema.

Then, the goal is to imitate cinema scene transitions without a camera. Actually a video game does have a camera. Although we may need a bit of abstraction to realise it, it is much easier to see in new 3D titles.

## Why do we need camera transitions

Camera transitions are not just an artistic resource the developers use to make the visual result smoother. The problem with a simply cut scene, where we just play a fotogram after the previous one ends, that would be the way we would do it in cinema if we do not have enough resources or we do not want to add any extra ornament. Is that video games are constantly opering with a huge amount of files, that if they are not well managed the performance will be affected. So developers use the transitions between scenes to unload and load the necessary data. The bigger the information we have to erase and write to the computer memory, the longest transition we will have to create.

Personally I find brilliant, the way that an artistic process, a method that has a strictly embellishing purpose in cinema, is also used to hide technical limitations.

Types of transitions
Again comparing both industries, cinema and video games, there are two general types of transitions commonly used:
The scene to scene transition, where is used any sort of effect to smooth the change. And the transition inside the same scene, in which although the scene doesn’t change we redirect the camera to focus on a different objective.

Scene to scene transition
### Fade in/out
The first scene gradually turns to a color (fade in), commonly black or white. And then, from the single color, it gradually appears the other scene (fade out). It is one of the transitions that takes much time, being a very smooth transition. From a narrative perspective, it signifies the past of time, being very clear when it ends and starts each scene.

### Zoom in/out
Is used when the camera zoom is drastically changed to direct the spectator attention. When it is changed from a long shot to a close up it is commonly to draw the attention to a single character, focusing on his expressions. And vice versa is to show a group of people or where they are situated, giving more importance to their presence in the environment.

### Dissolve
A dissolve transition is when two scenes overlay. Adjusting their transparency, gradually the first one becomes transparent to show the next scene. It is also one of the smoothest transitions we can use, also because it is commonly used to show landscapes or wide areas. So that to achieve a really smooth transition there would be a color concordance between both scenes to avoid drastic changes.

### Straight Wipe
A wipe transition is when a straight line, horizontal, vertical or practically any direction, travels the screen replacing the previous scene with the new one. The direction we decide to use could give us different meanings. Such as referring to the past, going from right to left side with a vertical line. Or indicate moral superiority, going from top to bottom with an horizontal line.
Despite its conventional uses we can give the wipe line any shape we want, adjusting in to our thematic or aesthetic.

### Wipe with shape
Despite its conventional uses we can give the wipe line any shape we want, adjusting in to our thematic or aesthetic.

### Adorned
This transition is practically the same as the wipe. But it uses extra graphic decoration to achieve a specific aesthetic. Because of its little naturalness it is only used in titles with a cartoon visual aesthetic or directed to a child audience.

### Pixelated
Most commonly used in pixel art games or old ones that have a low resolution. This technique consists in covering the screen with limited areas step by step in which we will be able to see the new scene.
